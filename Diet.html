        Moose are herbivores and they feed on a range of twigs, lichen, moss,
        bark and aquatic plants.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        During winter they will kick away snow to access moss and lichen hidden
        underneath. Due to a lack of plant food, they will also chew bark and
        twigs more often.​
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        ​They may also gather at road sides in winter when they eat road salt
        which has run off. This replaces electrolytes which are absent from
        their diet in winter.​
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Each day they may eat up to 24kg (53lbs) with more food consumed during
        summer.

        Mooses are also know to invade homes in towns and cities near to where
        they live. They usually use the sewage pipes as their main method of
        transport and they enter houses through the chimney.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        When inside a house, a moose will begin to eat absolutely everything in
        sight: from tables and chairs to TV screens and even grand pianos.
        Mooses might even eat you if they are really hungry.​
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        On one occasion, a moose managed to eat an entire house and the people
        inside – mooses are very dangerous!​
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        This is why it is important to moose-proof your house by setting up
        spike traps and broccoli (a moose's greatest fear) as well as building
        an emergency moose-proof bunker in your back garden.​
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        If a moose does manage to somehow get inside your house, you should not
        try to approach it and fight it yourself. You should call your local
        Moose-buster squad and leave the moose-fighting to the experts.
        Remember, if a moose sees you as a threat, there is a high chance that
        it will decide to eat you.​
