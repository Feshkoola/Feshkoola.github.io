      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>
        Moose are covered with a coating of brownish-grey fur in summer which
        turns greyer during winter. Their legs feature pale fur.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The legs are long and end with wide hooves helping them to wade through
        snow or cross snow. These legs also help them to wade through bogs and
        shallow lakes or allow them to cross fallen trees.
      </p>

        During the summer, males being to grow in their large antlers. These are
        covered by soft skin known as "velvet." This is shed by autumn when the
        breeding season begins.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Each antler may measure up to 2m (6.5ft) tall with up 20 points on
        each.​

        Hanging below the throat is a flap of skin known as the dewlap. This
        tends to become smaller as the animal grows. This may also be known as
        the bell.​

        The moose is the world's largest species of deer. Their body will
        measure between 2.4 and 3m (7.75 and 9.75ft) long with an average weight
        of between 500 and 700kg (1,100 and 1,550lbs). At the shoulder they
        stand 1.4-2.3m (4.5-7.5ft) tall.

        American moose tend to be larger than those in Europe. Males may be up
        to twice as large as the females.
