      <h2>Predators</h2>
      <p>
        Natural predators of the moose include bears, tigers and wolves. These
        animals target calves with the adult males using their large antlers to
        defend themselves.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        ​ Humans impact their population through forestry and agriculture which
        decreases the availability of their preferred forests.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Parasites such as ticks can also become a major threat. They will attach
        in large numbers to a moose potentially causing anemia. In an attempt to
        rid themselves of the ticks they will rub off patches of fur.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Some hunting occurs. In areas this may be to reduce their impact on
        forestry while in others it is for sport. They are also commonly
        impacted by vehicle strikes both on roads and trainlines.

      <h2>The Wild Javi</h2>
      <p>
        The moose's biggest predator today is the wild Javi. This monster of an
        animal can consume up to 10 million times its own weight. Therefore it
        is a large threat to every other animal.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        On one occasion a wild Javi was seen to have eaten a total of 67 mooses
        and 78 tonnes of wood. The USAF had to use rockets to safely remove the
        threat to neighbouring towns and villages.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Despite being so powerful, the wild Javi is an extremely endangered
        species and has not been sighted for the past 12 years. This is mainly
        due to the fact that these creatures are so greedy that by the age of
        only 10 years, they will attempt to eat themselves. If they manage to do
        so (which is usually the case) the only thing remaining would be its
        tummy – this contains the rest of the chewed up body.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        If you see a wild Javi in your house, you need to call the Javi Busters
        to come and sort out the situation before it eats everything within a 10
        km radius. Never try and approach a wild Javi as they are extremely
        dangerous and could eat the Empire States Building in less than 10 min.
        Stay Away!
